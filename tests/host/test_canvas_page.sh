# A MODULE MAY OWN A WHOLE PAGE, AND IT IS STILL A PAGE.
#
# The existing custom-UI surface is a `type: "canvas"` param you CLICK to dive
# into a fullscreen view. That view is not a page: you cannot jog to it, the
# encoders do not reach it, and it draws its own chrome. Asked for on hardware
# as "I have to dive in to see the faces instead of it being its own page, knobs
# do not work on the face, and the face does not animate".
#
# `as_page: true` makes it a page in the level's jog rotation, carrying THAT
# LEVEL'S OWN KNOBS.
#
# THE DESIGN DECISION WORTH KNOWING. It is an ordinary PAGE_KNOBS page that
# happens to carry a `canvas` field -- NOT a new page kind. Twenty-two places in
# page_controller branch on PAGE_KNOBS (reads, knob turns, touch, the touch
# strip, announce, dive targets, the list layout); a new kind would have to be
# threaded through every one, and missing one gives a page that looks right and
# does not respond. As a knobs page it inherits all of that untouched and only
# the picture differs.
#
# What must hold:
#   - the page is planned, in the rotation, with the level's knobs
#   - the canvas key does NOT also get a cell (it did, as an overflow page
#     holding one control -- "one page that is just the face")
#   - the module draws the BODY only; header and footer are the host's
#   - a drawer that throws is retired and the page survives
#
# NO APOSTROPHES BELOW THIS LINE inside the node script: it is a single-quoted
# bash string, and one apostrophe ends it early with an error pointing nowhere
# near the real line.
